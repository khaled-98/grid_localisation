**Grid Localisation**

This ROS package is part of my final year project which focuses on the evaluation of localisation algorithms for robot navigation in dynamic indoor environments. This specfic pacakage is an implemenation of the Grid Localisation algorithm as described in Probablistic Robotics by Thrun et al.

Please note that this is a work in progress and further updates/documentation will follow in due course.
